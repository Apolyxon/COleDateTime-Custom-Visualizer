### What are "Concord Extensibility Samples"?
[Concord](https://github.com/Microsoft/ConcordExtensibilitySamples/wiki/Overview) is the code name for Visual Studio's new debug engine that first shipped in Visual Studio 2012.  Concord was designed to be extensible and this repo contains samples of these extensions.
